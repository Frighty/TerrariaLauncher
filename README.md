This software helps running a Terraria server using a synced worlds folder (e.g. using folder sync software).
Whenever the server runs, there is a lock file in the synchronized world folder containing the server IP.

USAGE:
1. Choose world and a password. </br>
2. Start the server, if not already started by your bro (or sis, respectively XD).</br>
3. Start the client and join a multiplayer game.</br>
4. Paste the IP from clipboard when asked.</br>
5. Enter the password as discussed with your buddy.</br>
6. Have fun in Terraria.</br>
