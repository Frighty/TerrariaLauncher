Launches Terraria

This software helps running a Terraria server using a synced worlds folder (e.g. using folder sync software).
Whenever the server runs, there is a lock file in the synchronized world folder containing the server IP.

USAGE:
1. Choose world and a password
2. Start the server, if not already started by your bro (or sis, respectively XD).
3. Start the client and join a multiplayer game.
4. Paste the IP from clipboard when asked.
5. Enter the password as discussed with your buddy.
6. Have fun in Terraria.
